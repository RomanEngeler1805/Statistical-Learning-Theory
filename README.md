# Statistical-Learning-Theory

My solution to the coding exercises of the class "Statistical Learning Theory" (SLT) 2018 at ETH Zurich.
The sole purpose is to learn about techniques taught in class with no focus on performance i.e. the code is by no means optimized for fast run time.

The topics of the exercises are:
1) Locally linear embedding
2) MCMC Sampling
3) Deterministic Annealing
4) Histogram Clustering
5) Constant Shift Embedding
6) Pairwise Clustering
7) Mean Field Approximation
8) Model Validation
